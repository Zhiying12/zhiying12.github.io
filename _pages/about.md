I am a second-year Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Dr. Abutalib Aghayev](https://agayev.github.io/). I have broad interests in disbtributed systems and distributed consensus. 

Before coming to Penn State, I received my M.S. in Computer Science advised by Dr. Abhishek Chandra from University of Minnesota.
