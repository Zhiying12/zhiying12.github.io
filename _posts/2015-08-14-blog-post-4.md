This paper appeared in EuroSys 23. It proposed a resilient approach,
called [OmniPaxos](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3552326.3587441), to deal
with partial network partition. The partial network partition refers to a
scenario where two servers are unreachable from each other but connected by a
third server. The authors argue that, under the partial network connectivity
circumstance, traditional RSM systems (like Multi-Paxos, Raft, VR) may lead to
performance degradation and even stop progressing because of deadlocks or
livelocks.

## What is partial network partition?

This paper identifies and focuses on three types of partial network connectivity
that can lead to livelocks in existing RSM systems. All three scenarios are
shown in the graph borrowed from the paper.

- ***Quorum-loss scenario***. Given an initial cluster of five fully-connected
  servers , where Server C is the stable leader, the quorum-loss scenario may
  arise when all servers are connected to Server A only and disconnected from
  the rest. In this case, Server B, D, and E cannot become the leader because
  they only receive votes from Server A and itself at most, which is less than
  the majority requirement, while Server A will not start the leader election
  because it can still receive heartbeats from the existing leader C. \
  Though this claim is not fully valid, the authors argue that, except for Raft,
  the replication progress will be stalled because no functional leader will be
  elected. (However, we will show that MultiPaxos can handle this scenario as
  well in the later section).

* ***Constrained Election Scenario***. It is similar to the previous scenarios,
  but this time, Server A is disconnected from C. If A does not contain the
  latest log, for Raft, VR, and Zab, A cannot become the leader, because these
  protocols have log requirements for the leader election. Similarly, the
  replication progress will be suspended because of no leader.

- ***Chained Scenarios***. Given a cluster of three fully-connected servers,
  where Server B is the leader. If B and C become unreachable from each other,
  the
  chained scenario may occur. C will start the leader election and become the
  leader. When Server B learns about the new leader via A, it will trigger
  another
  round of leader election, because B will not receive any heartbeats from
  leader
  C. Similarly, when B becomes leader, C may start an election again. With
  repeated leader election, the cluster will lead to a livelock situation.

## How OmniPaxos deals with it?

This paper proposes a solution by introducing a concept called quorum-connected
servers for leader election and decoupling leader election and log replication.
A quorum-connected server maintains connection to at least the majority of
servers.

All servers exchange the information of what servers are quorum-connected
periodically. When the leader election happens, servers only vote for the
candidate with the highest ballot that is quorum-connected. Additionally,
OmniPaxos separates and modularizes leader election, log replication, and
reconfiguration, eliminating the requirement of the log for the leader election.
With these two main changes, OmniPaxos ensures a stable leader can always be
elected under the three partial network partition scenarios above.

## Can MultiPaxos survive under the quorum-loss scenario?

Despite the claim from the paper, we disagree with the claim and evaluation
results in the paper that MultiPaxos leads to deadlock in the case of the
quorum-loss scenario. We followed the classic MultiPaxos protocol and
implemented in C++. In our MultiPaxos implementation, it can easily elect
a new stable leader. As shown in the figure, there are several steps as follows.

1. When this quorum-loss scenario happens, all servers, except for Server A,
   lose the connection with C.
2. Then Server B, D, or E will trigger the leader election with a higher ballot
   and send prepare (P1) requests to A. Because of the higher ballot,
   Server A will give a promise to one of them and update its own ballot.
   Consequently, Server A will no longer respond to the heartbeat from the old
   leader C.
3. In the meantime, Server B, D, and E cannot become a new leader, A will not
   receive any heartbeats from the new leader, resulting in a timeout and
   another round of leader election initialized by A.
4. A will be the new leader, and the system will return to normal and make
   progress.

## Reevaluation on MultiPaxos under the quorum-loss scenario

We conducted an evaluation of our MultiPaxos implementation using the same
experiment setting from the OmniPaxos paper. We deployed five MultiPaxos
instances on AWS m5.2xlarge machines (8 cores and 32 GiB RAM). We repeated
experiments with timeout of 50, 500, and 5000 ms, respectively.

As shown in the figure above, it contradicts with the claim that MultiPaxos
would result in deadlock in the quorum-loss scenario. Though we do not optimize
MultiPaxos specifically for the partial network partition, the result shows that
MultiPaxos exhibits even better downtime performance than OmniPaxos. Compared
with OmniPaxos, MultiPaxos does not need to disseminate and relay the
information of quorum connectivity, thereby reducing the number of messages
exchanged among peers. Furthermore, MultiPaxos does not need extra policies for
leader election, but it still can achieve similar performance without those
implementation overhead.
